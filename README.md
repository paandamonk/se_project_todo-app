# Simple Todo App

This project allows the user to create a todo list.

## Functionality

You can add and delete todos from the list, as well as check them off, and keep a tally of how many todos you have completed against how many are active.

## Technology

This project uses a good amount of loose coupling to allow different classes to interact with each other without being entirely wrapped up in each other.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
